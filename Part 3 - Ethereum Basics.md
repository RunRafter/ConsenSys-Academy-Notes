## Accounts

- On the Blockchain, state is madeup of objects called "Accounts". Each account is a 20-byte address stored in a Patricia Merkle Tree.
- Account addresses represented in hex format.
- There are two types of accounts; Externally Owned Accounts, and Contract Accounts.
  - EOA's are controlled by people via private keys and are capable of:
    - maintaining a balance (Ether)
    - sending transactions on network (transferring value from balance  / initiating smart contract code)
    - controlled by private keys handled by account owners
    - keeps a nonce which tracks the number of transactions made by the account
  - CA's are similar to EOA's with the exception of being controlled directly by a person but rather a smart contract. CA's are unique in the sense that they can:
    - Can also transfer value and initiate other smart contract code
    - Call other contracts
    - Are initiated by external transactions
    - Has associated storage (where smart contract code stored), and can manipulate its storage
    - keeps a nonce which tracks the number of times it has itself deployed other contracts
- A public address (EOA) is derived from the last 20 bytes of the public key controlling the account after the public key has been passed through Keccak-256 hash.
- Contract accounts are created either by EOA's or other CA's when a contract is deployed. The new contract address is generated by using hash of the address of the deployer/parent account and the nonce of that account.

## Transactions

- Transactions are the mechanism in which state is modified in the blockchain. This can be accomplished through changing an ether account balance or by changing what is being stored in a contract.
- Transactions are always signed by the sender.
- Transactions can be sent from either EOA's or CA's and can include Ether or data.
- Not executed on blockchain until mined and included on a block.
- If the recipient of the data is a contract account, the incoming data will be executed by the smart contract.
- If the recipient is not specified or the public address is 0x0, then the transaction creates a new contract. The input data will be executed and the output is stored as the smart contract at a new address generated by the original senders public address and nonce.
- Ethereum transactions include:

  - Recipient Address
  - Nonce from sender's account (number of txns sent from that account)
  - Cryptographic Variables V, R, and S
    - USed to verify senders signature is valid
  - Gas Limit
    - Max. number of computational steps the tx execution is allowed to take.
  - Gas Price
    - Fee the sender pays per computational step (higher gas price = faster tx execution times)
    - Fluctuates with network demand
  - Value (optional)
    - Amount of Ether to send with tx (in Wei - 10^18 Wei = 1 ETH)
  - Data (optional)
    - Specifies contract instructions (function calls and paramters) or deployment instructions - create contracts or interact with contracts

## Gas and Fees

- Executing operations on the Etheruem network costs a fee (like a public utility) - is similar to a home or business that uses electricity available on a grid.
- Fees maintain security of network since POW can be expensive. Fees paid for txn proceessing is paid to miners as reward for including and processing txn in block.
- Gas is the metering unit for computations executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each computation consumes gas because they consume time and energy to process.
  - Gas paid for by Ether, must have sufficient amount in account
- Different computations cost different amounts of gas.
- Fees help prevent spam in the network, or infinite loops (prevent good code from running).
- A transaction must provide enough gas to cover all the computations that will be executed on the EVM. Each computation consumes some of the gas specified in the transactions gas limit.
  - If there is any gas remaining at the end of the transaction execution it is returned to the sender.
  - If not enough gas was provided the execution is halted, the miner recieves the gas provided and the sender gets nothing.
- Before any computation is performed the EVM must know that the user is capable of paying for it. Therefore startGas or gas is disclosed with the initally.

## Ethereum Structure
- Ethereum offers execution environment by including VM that operates on network state - ideal system for running smart contracts
- Worldwide distributed computer
- The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runs on every node in the network and handles all transactions being processed to determine current state of network.
- EVM is a complete, 256-bit Turing Complete VM that serves to execute arbitrary EVM bytecode.
- The EVM is slow when compared to most VM's (10-20 txns per second) however it also coordinates between an entire distributed network of nodes that are both slow and fast, each of which processing every transaction.
  - Each transaction/operation must be executed/processed simultaneously by every full node in network.
  - Slow processing is design feature that helps maintain decentralization by limiting hardware requirements.
  - Increased decentralization, immutability, significantly improved fault tolerance, zero downtime.
- The EVM runs on bytecode, a low-level stack-based language that specifies how state transitions are applied to the networks state.
- Ethereum transctions contain bytecode that is interpreted by the EVM.

- Contract accounts keep contract bytecode in storage, when a transaction is recieved the EVM executes the contract bytecode, resulting in an update in state of the system.
  ![Smart Contract Bytecode](/images/smartContract_Bytecode.png)

- There are several high level programming languages that are used to create contracts. Any contract written in a high level programming language is compiled into Bytecode prior to execution.
  - The most popular language is Solidity.
  
- When a valid block is found by miner, the block is broadcast with:
  - Txns list
  - Uncles list
  - Block header:
    - Previous block hash
    - State root
    - Txns root
    - Receipts root
    - Block number
    - Gas used
    - Timestamp
    - Nonce that miner used to find target hash

## Uncled Blocks

- Uncled blocks result from Ethereums short block times and proof-of-work, they are valid blocks that are discovered but not included in the main chain.
- In BTC, they're known as orphan blocks.
- Blocks are discovered approximately every 15 seconds, these short blocktimes require a low difficulty which results in a high frequency of simultaneous block discoveries.
  - Network delays and internet latency provide some nodes with the advantage of receieving discovered block notifications before other miners, therefore they are able to get a head start on mining new blocks. This promotes centeralization to nodes physically located near mining pools.
- In ethereum discovering uncled blocks is rewarded, the motive is to incentivize miner decentralization away from mining pools.
