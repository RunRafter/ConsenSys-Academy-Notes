## Decentralized App Development

- It is important to know whether using a DApp is a good option for given project.

- A DApp is a good choice if the project requires the following:
  - The system defines digital relationships between users
    - If so, account management offered by Ethereum might be appropriate
  - Application data needs to by dynamic and auditable
    - Need to be a record of changes to data set?
    - Blockchains record and store every update to state of the system
  - Central authority is not a requirement
    - Data that cannot be trusted in hands of a central authority might benefit from decentralized nature of blockchain integrity verification
    - integrity maintained by publicly broadcasting + verifying every txn
    - If transaction privacy is important, using centralized service better
  - Transaction speed is not of vital importance
    - Can take several block confirmations for txn to be accepted by some application
    
- Ethereum app developers build static front end pages that connect to ETH node/gateway. Through ETH gateway, users interact with smart contracts to read or change state of blockchain. ETH gateway relays info from ETH network to web app, showing state of network to user. Gateway also allows users to broadcast txns to network, which user initiates via web interface.

## Development Enviroment Setup

- Ethereum has several networks:
  - Mainnet: This is the real ethereum network, transactions actually cost ether, additionally this is the slowest option.
  - Testnets: This is used for development (typically beta tests) purposes only, ether is required for transactions but the ether is fake and therefore free.
  - Private Network: Transactions are instantly processed, and cost no ether but they are also completely isolated from other networks.
- When developing applications/ smart contracts all three of these networks would ideally be utilized fo
  - Phase 1 - Private Network
    - Rapid setup/ depoloyment/ testing
  - Phase 2 - Public Testnet
    - Closely resembles production enviroment
    - Test on a larger scale
    - Open to the public, bug bounties can be offered
  - Phase 3 - Ethereum Mainnet
    - Highest amount of risk
    - All transactions handle real value
- Ethereum has many tools used to connect to public/ private blockchains
  - Geth - instantiates connection to public/ private blockchain
    - Good for setting up personal private network with multiple nodes
  - Ganache (Truffle) - connects application to local private blockchain
    - Good for setting up early stage dev enviroments
  - Remix - connects to mainnet and simulates private blockchain
    - Good for testing smart contracts on testnets/ setting up early stage dev enviroments
  - Metamask - connects wallet to public/ private blockchain
    - Good for interacting with smart contracts deployed to testnets

### Development Workflow

1.  Create Account
2.  Fund Account - Faucets provide test ether for accounts on testnets
3.  Develop (Start of Testing Cycle)
4.  Compile - Remix/ SolC/ Truffle (framework that includes compiler)
5.  Sign & Deploy - Remix allows users to connect to Ethereum node and deploy contacts, Truffle offers complex multi-contract migration management
6.  Interact & Test (End of Testing Cycle) - Remix has functionality that allows users to transact with deployed contracts. Metamask lets users interact with deployed applications via browser extension. Truffle has a complex test automation framework baked in.

## Key Developer Tools

### Geth

- Geth is a gateway to the ethereum network, in short Geth is a node in the blockchain network it is connected to.
- The following features are included with Geth:
  - Connect to a blockchain or create one from scratch
  - Create and manage accounts
  - Fund accounts via mining or transafers from other accounts/ faucets
  - Deploy compiled contracts
  - Interact with deployed contracts
  - Although Geth is very versatile it is not the recommended way to interact with the mainnet due to its complexity.

### Parity

- Parity is an Ethereum client similar to Geth, that has a built-in DApp enviroment.
- The following features are included with Parity:

  - Most of the features that are available in Geth are also baked into Partiy, in many cases Parity offers more advanced features.
  - Multi-Signature wallets, smart contracts that can be controlled via different accounts
  - Enables creation and importing/ exporting of keys
  - Hardware and Cold-Storage electronic support
  - Name Registry support

### Mist

- Mist is a web3 browser that includes a wallet manager to create and manage user accounts.
- The following features are included with Mist:
  - Connects to the mainnet or testnet
  - Create and manage accounts
  - Fund accounts via mining or transafers from other accounts/ faucets
  - Compiled and deploy contracts
  - Interact with deployed contracts

### MetaMask

- Metamask is a Chrome/ Firefox browser extension that stores account addresses and enables private key signing.
- The following features are included with MetaMask:
  - MetaMask connects to an Ethereum gateway that can be defined by the user.
  - The extension injects the web3 object into the webpage to enable interaction with the Ethereum Gateway.
  - Creating and funding accounts is very intuitive

### Remix

- Remix is a web based solidity smart contract development IDE with an integrated debugger and testing enviroment.
- The following features are included with Remix:
  - Comes with file explorer capable of storing multiple solidity files.
  - Solidity Editor
  - Useful for accessing the blockchain state
  - Chat Support page
  - Simulate blockchain with pre-funded accounts or connect to a live network.
  - Can interact with any deployed contract.

### Truffle

- Truffle is a development framework for Ethereum.
- The following features are included with Truffle:
  - Comes with built-in smart contract compilation. linking, deployment, and binary management.
  - Built-in testing with Mocha and Chai
  - External script runner

### Ganache

- Ganache is a part of the Truffle Developer suite.
- The following features are included with Ganache:
  - Instantiates a local private blockchain that contains pre-funded accounts.
  - Allows user to run tests, inspect state, and execute commands.
  - Easily configured with MetaMask and Remix.

### Web3.js

- Web3.js is a collection of Javascript libraries that allow you to easily communicate with local or remote Ethereum nodes using the HTTP or IPC connection.
- The following features are included with Web3.js:
  - Abstracts away alot of the difficulty involved in interacting with a node via the JSON RPC
  - Web3 has all of the functionality of the node that it connects to.
  - Provides access to node functions to applications that the Web3 object is instantiated in

### IPFS and Swarm

- IPFS and Swarm are decentralized filed storage solutions for web 3.0
- Storing large amounts of data on the blockchain are impractical! IPFS and Swarm intend on addressing this issue.
- It is possible to store references to data kept in IPFS or Swarm in smart contracts as a reference to large datasets.
